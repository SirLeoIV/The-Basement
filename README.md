## THE BASEMENT

Imagine a horror game in a board-game-like environment. 
Enter the old basement of a long dead (?) alchemist with a party of characters. 
Find the hidden items and escape the basement in time before you turn insane by the horrors that live down there.

Play the game [here](https://sirleoiv.itch.io/the-basement)!

# How to play:
* Select the character you want to move with the mouse and control them with the buttons on the right side of the screen.
* Do not look at disturbing beings for too long. Keep your health and sanity in check!
* Sanity recovers, health does not!
* After you retrieved all the items [or you just cannot stand the horrors anymore],
  escape the basement by navigating the characters to the top of the stairs. Once a player exits the basement, they can not return.
